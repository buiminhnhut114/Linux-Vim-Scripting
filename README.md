# 🧠 Linux-Vim-Scripting — Assignments

This repository contains four scripting exercises for Linux users, focusing on RTL file listing, list comparison, path replacement, and regression automation.

---

## 📘 1. Generate a list of all `.v` and `.sv` files in **PULPissimo**

### 🎯 Goal
- Create a file (for example: `pulpissimo_files.list`) that contains **all** `.v` and `.sv` files inside the PULPissimo project directory.  
- Each line should contain one file path (absolute or relative).  
- No empty lines, no duplicates.

### 📄 Expected Output
pulpissimo_files.list

## ⚙️ 2. Write a script to compare two list files

### 🎯 Goal
- Compare two list files: `list_1` and `list_2`.
- The script must output:
  - Files **missing** in `list_2` (present in `list_1` but not in `list_2`)
  - Files **extra** in `list_2` (present in `list_2` but not in `list_1`)
  - The **number of missing and extra** files

### 🧩 Example
```text
list_1: aaa.v bbb.v ccc.v
list_2: aaa.v bbb.v
⇒ Result: list_2 is missing 1 file: ccc.v
📥 Input
list_1, list_2

📤 Output
missing_in_list2.txt

extra_in_list2.txt

Summary (printed on screen or written to compare_summary.txt)

🔄 3. change_path — Replace paths inside a file
🎯 Goal
Create a script change_path (any scripting language) that takes three arguments:

The target file name (e.g., file_A)

The source path to be replaced (e.g., home/spi/rtl_src)

The target path to replace with (e.g., home/spi/rtl_src_new)

Replace all occurrences of the source path in the file with the target path.

Preserve all other content in the file.

🧩 Example
bash
Copy code
./change_path.csh file_A home/spi/rtl_src home/spi/rtl_src_new
This replaces every home/spi/rtl_src in file_A with home/spi/rtl_src_new.

📥 Input
file_A, source_path, target_path

📤 Output
Updated file_A (optionally keep a backup .bak)

🧪 4. Regression Runner Script
🎯 Goal
Automatically run multiple testcases listed in testlist and generate:

Individual log files: TC1.log, TC2.log, ...

A summary report: testlist.rpt

⚙️ Requirements
testlist contains testcase names, one per line (e.g., TC1, TC2, …).

The script runs each testcase sequentially.

Each testcase’s result is written into its own log file.

The report testlist.rpt summarizes the results as PASS, FAIL, or NA:

PASS / FAIL / NA is determined from each testcase’s log file.

NA means the testcase could not compile or could not run simulation.

🧩 Example
text
Copy code
testlist: TC1 TC2 TC3 TC4 TC5

Generated output:
  TC1.log
  TC2.log
  TC3.log
  TC4.log
  TC5.log
  testlist.rpt

Content of testlist.rpt:
  TC1: PASS
  TC2: FAIL
  TC3: PASS
  TC4: NA
  TC5: PASS

Report directory : <path to directory containing TC*.log>
📥 Input
testlist (path to the testcase list file)

📤 Output
Report directory (e.g., reports/) containing TC*.log and testlist.rpt
